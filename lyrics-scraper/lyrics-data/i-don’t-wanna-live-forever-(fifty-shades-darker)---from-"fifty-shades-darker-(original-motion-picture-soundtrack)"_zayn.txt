Zay Lyve
(Verse 1)
See that choppa chopping down eat you nigga like chewbacca
Thought about quiting still blowing like a rasta
They tried to keep a nigga middle finger to the coppas
With the money off the white yeah a nigga eating lobster
RRRAAAWWWRR !

(Hook)

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

(Verse 2)
Big money lay it on the triple beam
Drop it in the pot and watch that lil nigga steam
Oops i ment white girl, ya gon' pipe her
Pull out the tube then you all ignite her
RRRAAAWWWRR !

Young nigga tryna chase my dream
All i know is straight money and serving to straight feens
We all showing out like Jordan in 93
I'm talking about my fam you talking about your team

When I  say my niggas coming bitch we all in here
Best believe my strap always stay near
And my wrist on froze check out the audemear
Plus my neck might blind ya heres a tip don't stair

Gotta bitch name Nicki, love wearing Vicky
But I got a main bitch so i tell her no hickys
All my niggas gon' slide and all yo niggas gon die
And when my niggas get to riding see my niggas get to fin' (Firing)

Got ya house on watch niggas in the bushes
But yeen (You ain't) gon' find 'em at the end when ya looking
See that money, hoes, lean all i think about
Purple got a nigga on his ass bitch im leaning out

I'm gwoping on them hatters I'm just tryna see the top
And if I don't its back to selling weed and whipping straight rocks
1 thing i can't forget when I was trapping on that block
Me and my niggas going hard we ain't eva (Ever) think to stop

See I'm that lil nigga that them haters steddy looking at
They tried to take the thrown so I went ahead and took it back
Ya flow going down I'm going up like a jumping jack
Pledge allegiance to the swag grab it like a heart attack

You tried to join the team we ain't see ya application
Dro and Kool-Aid 1 of the 3 combonations
If it ain't about money no need for conversating
Stop sign on the shirt tell these niggas stop the hating

Only 15 with a grade A flow
I remember grade school we was siting on the flo' (Floor)
Teacher ask me what i wunna be i told her ima rapper
Any nigga in my way ima jump and straight pass 'em
