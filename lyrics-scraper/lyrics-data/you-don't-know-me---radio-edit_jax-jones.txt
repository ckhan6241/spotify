[Intro]
Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your hoe, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me
("What you-what you gonna do?")

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, time is money so don't fuck with mine
See I'm out with my girls, I'ma have a good time
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe

[Refrain]
See, I can't get too much of a good thing
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing

[Chorus]
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Na, thanks for askin'"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

[Interlude]
I mean, we could throw shapes together
But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah

[Verse 2]
Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up

[Refrain]
See, I can't get too much of a good thing
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things
Well, please hold your tongue, oh, don't say a damn thing

[Chorus]
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Na, thanks for askin'"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah
Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

[Bridge]
Come round here, just know though
Won't get what you want, what you want, what you want, want
Tell you what you don't know
I get what I want, what I want, what I want, want

[Chorus]
See your iPhone camera flashin'
Please step back, it's my style you're crampin'
"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Na, thanks for askin'"

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
I am not your homie, not your, hoo, na na yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na na yeah
You don't know me, fuck yeah

[Outro]
You don't know me, fuck yeah
